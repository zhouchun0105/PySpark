PySpark MLlib: built-in library for scalable machine learning
**ML Algorithms**: collaborative filtering, classification, and clustering
**Featuriation**: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction and selection
**Pipelines**: tools for constructing, evaluating and tuning ML pipelines


Compare to scikit-learn:
* Scikit-learn algorithms only work for small datasets on a single machine
* Spark's MLlib algorithms are designed for parallel processing on a cluster
* Supports languages such as Scala, Java and R
* Provides a high-level API to build machine learning pipelines




collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).
